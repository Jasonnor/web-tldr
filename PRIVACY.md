# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** December 18, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how the **Web TL;DR for NotebookLM** extension ("we", "us", or "our") handles your information. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about our data practices.

## 1. Data Collection and Usage

We prioritize your privacy. We **do not** collect, store, sell, or transmit your personal data, browsing history, or website content to any third-party servers, analytics services, or the developer.

The extension operates locally on your device and interacts solely with the services you explicitly authorize.

### How Data is Processed

The extension only processes data when you explicitly trigger an action (e.g., clicking the extension icon or using the context menu).

* **URLs and Page Titles**: Used to direct Google NotebookLM to the content you wish to summarize.
* **Selected Text**: If you choose to summarize a text selection, that specific text is temporarily copied to your clipboard or passed directly to the NotebookLM interface.

This data is strictly transmitted directly from your browser to **Google NotebookLM** (`https://notebooklm.google.com`) to perform the requested summarization. We do not have access to this data.

## 2. Permissions

We only request permissions that are essential for the extension's functionality:

* **`activeTab`**: To access the URL and title of the current tab only when you click the extension icon.
* **`contextMenus`**: To add "Summarize" options to your right-click menu.
* **`storage`**: To save your local preferences (e.g., your custom prompt or background tab settings). These settings are stored locally in your Chrome browser and are not synced to us.
* **Site Access (`notebooklm.google.com`)**: To automate the process of pasting content and submitting prompts within the NotebookLM interface.

## 3. Third-Party Services

This extension is a tool designed to interact with **Google NotebookLM**. When you use this extension, you are interacting with Google's services. We encourage you to review Google's privacy policy to understand how they handle data uploaded to their platform:

## 4. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. The current version will always be available in our code repository.

## 5. Contact Us

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our privacy practices, please contact us via the support section on the Chrome Web Store listing or through our GitHub repository.
